<p>Bullets / Explosion (Bullets "over" Explosions) was made during UCI's Video Game Development Club's (VGDC) 2016 Winter Quarter Game Jam, by the team of Ben Everett, Roldan Gammad, Edwin Ho, and Joshua Wardlaw. Bullets / Explosion won second place overall during the game jam.</p>

<p>Bullets / Explosions (Bullets "over" Explosions) is a 2D top-down puzzle shooter with 16 levels. The player is given a certain amount and type of "bullet" for each level, with which they must shoot all of the targets and cause a certain amount of explosions. If the player uses more bullets then they are allotted, fails to reach the specified number of explosions (no more, no less), or fails to hit all of the targets, the player must redo the level.</p>

<p>The VGDC held a game jam during the 2016 Winter Quarter with the theme of "There is never enough".
The Bullets / Explosion team chose to satisfy this theme with the following:
1)          There is never enough bullets
2)          There is never enough 
3)          There is never enough 
4)          There is never enough screen shake
5)          There is never enough time to read the title cards
6)          There is never enough levels
7)          There is never enough memes</p>
